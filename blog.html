                        Fear not the children roaming in the streets,<br>
                        Their small, dirty fingers pressing on the pristine windows of your Ford Ranger FX4,<br>
                        Begging for a 1-peso coin that might not even fill their stomachs,<br>
                        Their eyes coated with the indifference that a bright future will never come.<br><br>

                        Fear not the man wasting away on a run-down factory somewhere in Bacolod,<br>
                        Waiting for the day he stops living from paycheck to paycheck.<br>
                        His fridge is empty and the bills are piling high,<br>
                        So he closes his eyes, smiles, and jumps off from the rope that's tied to the ceiling.<br><br>

                        Fear not the woman who's a student activist,<br>
                        Whose throat becomes hoarse from demanding to end Indigenous killings.<br>
                        One day she witnessed a soldier dragging a B'laan by the hair to the barracks.<br>
                        She runs to the nearest police station.<br>
                        By dusk, she is found floating in the river with her tongue cut and her eyes gouged out.<br><br>

                        Instead, fear the policemen stomping away on the cold concretes of the night,<br>
                        Armed with a weathered gun half-tucked in their belts,<br>
                        Making their rounds across the barrio as if they're dedicated to duty,<br>
                        And waiting for the next teenage girl to come out of the safety of her home,<br>
                        To drag her under horrors of the night.<br><br>

                        Fear the politicians with promises of "helping" the poor,<br>
                        They eat up all your support and flush it down the toilet after.<br>
                        I heard they buy their smiles from the plastic surgeon down the street.<br>
                        They will never help you, don't count on that.<br>
                        They count gold instead of responsibilities.<br><br>

                        Fear the judge, the jury, and the lawyer of the courtroom,<br>
                        You never know if their justice is tainted with the whisper of gold.<br>
                        You plead for your innocence, knowing the guards planted the gun and the sachet of powder under your blanket.<br>
                        But your Christian lawyer will plead you guilty as if he's never heard of God.<br><br>

                        Fear the rich who preach their sin-free lifestyle like they're the descended angels of social media.<br>
                        The know the wine that they're drinking comes from a winery that enslaves their grape farmers.<br>
                        But they post about it and say, "How delicious! I'll buy another bottle."<br>
                        Their son also rapes and murders women like they're mere toys, but his parents say,<br>
                        "Who would be interested in that?"<br><br>

                        Who do we fear? Who don't we fear?<br>
                        Everything becomes crystal clear,<br>
                        When you ask their thoughts and hear,<br>

                        The cup in my hand feels heavy.<br><br>

                        Just a little movement and the liquor shifts, 
                        creating ripples across its enclosure. 
                        The wine, velvet, reflects the lone moon on the horizon. 
                        I have forgotten how that used to taste like.<br><br>

                        Ever since...<br><br>

                        Velvet. 
                        As I continue to look inside the cup which holds the wine, 
                        I couldn't help but think of…<br><br>

                        Velvet--like her hair.<br><br>

                        I down half the cup in one go.<br><br>

                        The liquor shifts and all I see is blood--<br><br>

                        "-mien..."<br><br>

                        I whip my head up. For a second, all I see is her.<br><br>

                        Radiant under the moonlight, 
                        her smile rivaling the splendor of the moon. 
                        Velvet hair sprawls effortlessly over her shoulders and curls over her hips. 
                        She beckons and I reach a hand.<br><br>

                        "Damien!"<br><br>

                        She vanishes.<br><br>

                        In her wake, brown replaces red and a frown replaces the smile upon her lips. 
                        My sister--Herida--looks upon me with horror and pity.<br><br>

                        "Damien."<br><br>

                        I look back upon my cup only to see her gone. 
                        I rub a hand over my eyes.<br><br>

                        "I'm sorry to have startled you awake, Hers. 
                        You were never meant to see me this way," I said to her.<br><br>

                        Footsteps near me and I look up; we hold gazes before she faced the horizon.<br><br>

                        "I liked her, you know." She opened and closed her mouth, 
                        as if tasting the words on her tongue. "She was pretty--Evangeline."<br><br>

                        I flinch at the name.<br><br>

                        My lips tremble as I carefully chose words that wouldn't betray my emotions--put a leash on the tears threatening to escape my eyes. 
                        I fail, however, when the words started to chole on my throat. 
                        "Yeah. Ev-Evangeline..."<br><br>

                        Hunching over, I release all the pent-up emotions I've been harboring all night:
                        grief, anger, and sadness. 
                        The cup slips from my hand and velvet splashes onto the ground.<br><br>

                        Once again, I see her in the wine. 
                        Sprawled effortlessly on the ground, her velvet hair a shade ligter 
                        than the velvet liquid underneath her.<br><br>

                        She smiles, and I bitterly laugh.<br><br>

                        Evangeline...<br><br>

                        A warm hand settles upon my back and I couldn't help but think…<br><br>

                        Evangeline...<br><br>

                        If only you hadn't seen that...<br><br>

                        I wouldn't had to kill you.

                        <b>In the Beginning</b><br><br>

                        Dear Diary,<br><br>

                        I do hope I've taken the right action for what I had done today. 
                        I really do hope so. Otherwise, I'd get punished for what I thought I had been doing right, 
                        when it reality, I had done something evil.<br><br>

                        You see, I've given away something valuable of mine, 
                        something given to me by the angels as a token. 
                        It was a flaming sword, and it flamed like anything. 
                        But Eve was already expecting and the pair had no means to protect themselves 
                        the moment they were cast off from the Garden of Eden. 
                        Additionally, the first storm had been brewing ever since then. 
                        It was the least bit of help I could give, I thought, giving away the sword.<br><br>

                        Crowley, the demon who transformed into a serpent to tempt Adam and Eve, 
                        joked that it would be funny if we both got it wrong, 
                        that he did the good thing and I did the bad. 
                        But it just made me just a little bit more anxious.<br><br>

                        Ooo, I really do hope it was the best course of action. 
                        Otherwise, Iid really be punished by the angels.<br><br>

                        Hoping,<br><br>

                        Dear Diary,<br><br>

                        Crowley and I have come to a tacit agreement to supervise in the upbringing 
                        of the Antichrist. He told me the child isn't evil of itself, it's got everything 
                        to do with potentiality. He might be potentially good, and potentially evil all 
                        at the same time. Well, I do agree with him. Despite the child's blood and nature, 
                        he still is a child, after all.<br><br>

                        I thought it'd be worth the shot, trying to raise the child with as much 
                        supervision from Heaven as he can. Of course, I couldn't peep of this to my 
                        superiors Above, and neither can Crowley. I guess it's all up to us both to 
                        become the best godfathers that we can be.<br><br>

                        Godfathers. I've never thought there would come a day.<br><br>

                        Just a little bit excited,<br><br>

                        Aziraphale<br><br><br>

                        <b>Wednesday</b><br><br>

                        Dear Diary,<br><br>

                        We raised the wrong child. Oh my, we just raised the wrong child.<br><br>

                        I'd be damned if Armageddon starts because of this.<br><br>

                        Panicking,<br><br>

                        Aziraphale.<br><br><br>

                        <b>Saturday</b><br><br>

                        Dear Diary,<br><br>

                        The past few days felt like--what do you call those things?--a rollercoaster ride. 
                        Fortunately since my last entry, we've managed to locate the Antichrist through 
                        an extensive reading of The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch. 
                        Then, Crowley and I had been separated by the interference of our superiors. 
                        Truthfully, I'd been quite lonely without the demon by my side.<br><br>

                        It's been millennium since we've had to part ways for quite a long period of time.<br><br>

                        However, we were still able to accomplish what we originally planned—to push 
                        back the date for Armageddon. 
                        It's been quite a journey up until this point, 
                        but Crowley's still Crowley and I'm still me. 
                        And to put it frankly, I'm happy our superiors turned a blind eye on the situation. 
                        Otherwise, they would've found out about our arrangement and we would've been taken.<br><br>

                        I hope it'll be a few more millennia that I'll get to share this friendship 
                        with the serpent.<br><br>

                        Satisfied,<br><br>

                        Aziraphale.
